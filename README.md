# Smart Event Planner
This is a Countdown & Quotes Web Application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Users can set a future date and time, and the app displays a live countdown in days, hours, minutes, and seconds. Once the countdown ends, it shows a celebratory message. Alongside the countdown, the app cycles through motivational quotes every 4 seconds, fading in and out smoothly to keep users inspired.

The design features a modern gradient background, a glassmorphism-style container, and responsive layout for mobile screens. The app also includes input validation to ensure that only future dates can be selected.
