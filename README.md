# Description
This JavaScript program is a menu-driven system offering four features:

Fitness System – Takes age and weight, compares them with healthy ranges, and suggests if the user is fit, underweight, or overweight.

Monthly Budget Planner – Takes monthly income and gives financial advice based on income range.

Mobile Data Usage System – Takes monthly data usage (in GB) and categorizes it as low, normal, or heavy usage.

Password System – Validates old password and checks if new and confirm passwords match before updating.

It uses prompt() for input, console.log() for output, if-else conditions for decision-making, and a menu selection via choice.
