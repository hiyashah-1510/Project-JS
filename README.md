# Smart Calculator
This project is a simple calculator built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The design uses a modern glass-effect style with gradient background, rounded buttons, and a responsive layout. The calculator supports basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus, along with extra features such as AC (clear all), DEL (delete last), decimal input, and double zero (00). The JavaScript code handles user input by storing two numbers (num1, num2) and the selected operator, updating the display in real time. When the = button is pressed, the calculator evaluates the expression, shows the result rounded to two decimals, and resets for the next calculation.
