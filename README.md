This is a New Year’s Countdown and Motivational Quotes App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It combines a live countdown timer with inspirational quotes that change automatically.

Countdown Timer

Counts down to January 1, 2026, at 00:00:00.

Displays the remaining time in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

The quotes have a fade animation, making them visually appealing.
