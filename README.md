# Project-JS
# Description

This JavaScript code performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus) between two numbers a and b, and uses a ternary operator to prevent division or modulus by zero. It then logs the results to the console using template literals for formatting.
