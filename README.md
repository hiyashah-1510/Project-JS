# Project Description

The Student Result System is a web-based application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to sign up, log in, and manage student results securely. Each user can add, view, edit, and delete their own results. The project uses MockAPI to store data online, including user accounts and result records. It has a modern dark theme dashboard and includes features like authentication, form validation, and dynamic data display.
