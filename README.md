# Project-JS
# Smart Calculator
📌 Description

    This project is a modern scientific calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It not only performs basic arithmetic operations 
    but also supports advanced functions like square, cube, factorial, and even/odd checking. The design uses a glassmorphism UI with 
    gradients, blur effects, and styled buttons for a professional look. JavaScript handles all the logic, including error detection such 
    as invalid inputs or division by zero, ensuring smooth performance.
